# Sparse Matrix Project

## Overview

This project implements a Sparse Matrix class in Python, allowing for efficient storage and manipulation of large matrices with a significant number of zero elements. The class provides methods for loading matrices from files, saving matrices to files, and performing various matrix operations.

## Features

- Load sparse matrices from text files.
- Save sparse matrices to text files.
- Support for basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication, etc.).
- Error handling for file format inconsistencies.
